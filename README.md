# TboiSeeds
I made a The Binding of Isaac website which saves seeds and generates randomly seeds picked by me.
For storing data I used google's firebase. 
On the first page you can add a seed, view all added seeds or generate a random seed.
To add a seed you must enter your username and the seed. Description is not necessary.
The seed must be valid - It must have 8 symbols, only alphanumeric characters are accepted except for 5, I, O, and U.
After you click on the "Add seed" button your seed will be added to the databse and displayed on the "All seeds" page where you will find every existing seed in the database.
On the "Random seed page" you will see a random generated seed from a list of the best seeds handpicked and tested by me.
If you find any bugs feel free to contact me.
Enjoy :-)
